[h1] What is this mod ? [/h1]
This is a cannibilized version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133528728]  ADVENT Avengers Ability Tweaks [/url]  mod, taking the Passive Vest/Item Icons code. Made with permission.
I also kept the minor changes to base game vests as I think they fit well and I wanted these additions too. All changes listed below.

[b]Includes icons for;[/b]
Stasis Vest, Hellweave Vest, Hazmat Vest, (Passive) Wall Phasing/Wraith, Mindshields, Medikits, NanoMedikits, SkullMine (Icon Swap), Low Visibility (Icon Swap), Melee Resistance (Icon Colour Swap), Sustaining Sphere (Icon Colour Swap), Holy Warrior (Icon Colour Swap) Icarus Vault (Icon Colour Swap), Ruler Armour Passive Panic

[b]Includes icons for 'popular' mods;[/b]
For these I have added extra localizations for the ability the item gives. This allows the information to show up on the passive icon in the tactical layer. This information has been copied and simplified from the base mods equipment template.
My localisation should only show up IF the original item doesn't have any. It'll also start with ***** in 'rusty red'. This is to highlight that the information might not be upto date (for example if the original mod gets updated after the last time this was).
For these mod added item icons I did not seek permission from the original mod creators, if any mod creator wishes for me to remove a passive icon/localization for your item please let me know.
On a similar note if anyone has a mod added item that grants a passive ability/immunity that does not have an icon, please let me know and I'll try to add one in.

ADVENT Drones Anti-Stun Vest, Flame Viper Vest, Valentines Viper Vest, Bio Division 2.0 Vests, BioMedikits, CX Frost Vest, CX Wraith Vest, Bitterfrost Protocols Frostweave, Advanced Mindshield, Refraction Fields Immunities, Metal over Flesh Shields (Icon Swap), GTS SPARK Perks Regeneration (Icon Swap), HIVE Armour Wall Climb (Position Swap).

[h1]Bonus Changes;[/h1]
ALL bonus changes can now be toggled off in the config file, default to on
[olist]
[*] NanoMedikits and BioMedikits provide immunity to poison and chryssalid venom.
[*] Changes the Stasis Vest to give immunity to bleeding. 
[i]This is to give XCOM a possible counter to the Dark Event: Stilleto Rounds.[/i]
[*] Changes the Hazmat Suit to include immunity to electrical and frost damage types. 
[i]It's suppose to be a anti-hazard suit[/i]
[*] Changes Hellweave to deal fire damage and exposes the damage values to the config.ini. By Default it does 4-5 fire damage, 1 less to any enemy with armour. 
This change can be completely disabled in the config by setting bPI_DAMAGECHANGE_HELLWEAVE to false. 
Hellweave now grants immunities to fire and chryssalid venom. 
[i]Makes more sense to me to be fire based and it's made from chryssalids.[/i] The damage type can changed in the config.
[*] Makes Holy Warrior not break concealment
[*] Adds the Flame Viper, Muton Elite, Muton Centurion Elite, Muton Commando Elite, CX BerserkerOmega and CX EUBerserker to their respective Ruler Armour Panic Unit Types.
[/olist]

[h1]Compatibility;[/h1]
Not be used with the Core Collection Edition [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2170324254] Passive Icons: Core Collection Edition [/url].
Includes config options to turn off any icon/code changes.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133528728]  ADVENT Avengers Ability Tweaks [/url]  Mod contains a compatibility fix within his mod to make these work together without issue.
Should work fine mid campaign, but maybe not mid-tactical.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1731235406] Bio Division 2.0[/url] changes how Medikits work. Part of this change removes the immunity to poison they grant. This also handily removes my Passive Icon too.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1129753213] Armor & vest Config [/url] Replaces the original vests abilities with custom versions. This will remove the Passive Icons this mod provides. Unless the A&V config is adjusted.

[h1]Credits and Thanks to;[/h1]
MrShadowCX for pointing out that I was impolitely stepping on other mods with my localizations added immunities and making me implement things in a better way
